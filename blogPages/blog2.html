           Like a lot of people, I use addons on my (Firefox) browser. In this post, I'm going to describe my addons, and explain why I use them.

Chameleon:

Chameleon is a privacy addon that changes some of the HTTP headers that your browser sends along
with every request. Such as language, browser, OS, timezone, and more!

Panorama Tab Groups:

Panorama Tab Groups  is a tab managing addon that's different from the crowd. Instead of putting
your tabs in an list, it puts your tabs in groups all over the screen. 

Tabliss:

Tabliss is definitely an aesthetic addon. It replaces your tab page with a picture, and widgets
of your choice.

Tridactyl:
This is an addon that best summed up with a quote "Vim, but in your browser" -Tridactyl
It allows you to control just about everything in Firefox with the keyboard.

UBlock Origin:
This one probably needs no intro, its an ad blocker. With no noticeable effect on system 
resources, as well as being open source, it easily the best browser based add blocker.
