           Like a lot of people, I use addons on my (Firefox) browser. In this post, I'm going to describe my addons, and explain why I use them.  <br>

Panorama Tab Groups:<br>

Panorama Tab Groups  is a tab managing addon that instead of putting<br>
your tabs in an list, it puts your tabs in grid that takes up the whole screen. <br>

Tridactyl:<br>
This is an addon that is best summed up with a quote "Vim, but in your browser" -Tridactyl<br>
It allows you to control just about everything in Firefox with the keyboard.<br>

UBlock Origin:
This one probably needs no intro, its an ad blocker. With no noticeable effect on system <br>
resources, as well as being open source, it easily the best browser based add blocker.<br>
