            <p>
            Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone, all of these are mobile or web applications<br>
            for simplifying the process of learning a foreign language. However, many such<br>
            applications simply the process to much. In this post, I will outline my objections<br>
            to these applications, then explain my process to follow instead.<br>
            (Do note, both my objections and process are orientated for Latin alphabet based languages.<br>
            and may not necessarily work reflect languages that use other systems.)
            </p>
            <p>
            The first objection is the fact that applications often teach nouns way more often than other<br>
            types of words such as verbs or adjectives. This will give an improper grasp of a language.<br>
            Second, most of these applications use the "Parrot learning method", or these applications teach<br>
            you a language like you would teach a parrot. This will lead to poor understanding of phonics,<br>
            grammar, or more unique quirks of a language. Finally, these applications often teach a very<br>
            formal form of a language.<br><br>

            Here's what I do instead. <br>
            1.Get a grasp on the alphabet,<br>
            2.Practice your language's phonics.<br>
            3.Learn pronouns.<br>
            4.Practice common verbs and their different tenses.<br>
            5.Learn about other unique, grammatical quirks of a language.
